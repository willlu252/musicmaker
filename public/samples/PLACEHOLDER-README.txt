# Placeholder Sample Files
# These are temporary placeholder files to test your musicmaker interface
# Replace with real samples from the download guide

# To create basic placeholder audio files on Windows:
# 1. Record short sounds using Windows Voice Recorder
# 2. Or use online tone generators to create simple beeps
# 3. Save as .mp3/.wav and rename to match requirements
